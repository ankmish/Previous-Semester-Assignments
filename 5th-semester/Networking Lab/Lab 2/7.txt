 TCP Basics
------------


Answer the following questions using the tcp-ethereal-trace-1 packet trace to answer the questions
below :


3. SeqNo 0 is used to initiate a TCP connection. A SYN flag which is set (1) identifies it as a SYN segment.


4. SeqNo 0 is also used in reply to the client. Acknowledgement field is set to 1; Both SYN and ACK flags are set which identifies it as SYN ACK segment.
The value of the acknowledgement field in the SYNACK segment is determined by adding 1 to the initial sequence number of SYN segment from the client computer. 


5. 164041 is the seqNo for HTTP POST command.


6. The HTTP POST segment is considered as the first segment. Segments 1 – 6 are No. 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 
        and 11 in this trace respectively. The ACKs of segments 1 – 6 are No. 6, 9, 12, 14, 15, and 16
        in this trace.
        Segment 1 sequence number: 1 
        Segment 2 sequence number: 566
        Segment 3 sequence number: 2026
        Segment 4 sequence number: 3486
        Segment 5 sequence number: 4946 
        Segment 6 sequence number: 6406
		
Below is the list of SENT time - RECEIVED time - RTT :
Seg 1 - 0.026477 - 0.053937 - 0.02746
Seg 2 - 0.041737 - 0.077294 - 0.035557
Seg 3 - 0.054026 - 0.124085 - 0.070059
Seg 4 - 0.054690 - 0.169118 - 0.11443
Seg 5 - 0.077405 - 0.217299 - 0.13989
Seg 6 - 0.078157 - 0.267802 - 0.18964

EstimatedRTT = 0.875 * EstimatedRTT + 0.125 * SampleRTT


7. The length of the first TCP segment is 565 bytes. The length of each of the following five TCP segments is 1460 bytes.


8. The minimum amount of buffer space advertised at the received for the entire trace - 5840.
   No.


9. No, there isn't any retransmitted segments in the trace file. I checked the sequence graph to answer this question.


10. Data typically acknowledged by the receiver in an ACK - 1460.
	The cases in 78 & 79 show where the reciever is acking every other segment ie 1460*2=2920 bytes.


11. Time of First segment= 0.026477
	Time of Last segment= 5.455830
 	SeqNo of first segment=1
	SeqNo of last segment=164091 

Total data transfered = 164091-1 = 164090
Total time taken = 5.455830 - 0.026477 =5.4294 seconds.
Hence total speed = 164090/5.4294=30.222 KB/sec
