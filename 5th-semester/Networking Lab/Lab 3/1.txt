I. Simple IP Trace
--------------------


Note: Answer the following questions using the ip-ethereal-trace-1 packet trace to answer the questions
below : 

1) Src: 192.168.1.102

2) The protocol is 1 which refers to ICMP

3)  IP header has 20 bytes 
	Total length is 84 bytes.
	Since ip header has 20 bytes, payload= 84-20 = 64 bytes

4)  The data is not fragmented since more fragment bit=0

5)	Time to live, Identification and checksum always change

6)
 The fields that stay constant across the IP datagrams are:
• Version (since we are using IPv4 for all packets)
• header length (since these are ICMP packets)
• source IP (since we are sending from the same source)
• destination IP (since we are sending to the same dest)
• Differentiated Services (since all packets are ICMP they use the same Type of Service class)
• Upper Layer Protocol (since these are ICMP packets)
The fields that must stay constant are:
• Version (since we are using IPv4 for all packets)
• header length (since these are ICMP packets)
• source IP (since we are sending from the same source)
• destination IP (since we are sending to the same dest)
• Differentiated Services (since all packets are ICMP they use the same Type of Service class)
• Upper Layer Protocol (since these are ICMP packets)
The fields that must change are:
• Identification(IP packets must have different ids)
• Time to live (traceroute increments each subsequent packet)
• Header checksum (since header changes, so must checksum) 


7) The identification field increases by 1 every time

8)
Identification field:0x00009d7c (40316)
TTL : 255



II. Fragmentation
-------------------

Sort the packet listing according to time again by clicking on the Time column. 


9) No because fragment bit is 0

10) No

11)
The second fragment is obvious because it now has a a fragment offset of 1480.
There are no more fragments because it no longer has a flag set for more fragments.

12)
Fragment offset, total length, more fragments bit, TTL and the checksum.
