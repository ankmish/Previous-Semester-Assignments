													ARP

I. Capturing and analyzing Ethernet frames
---------------------------------------------

Note: Answer the following questions using the ethernet-ethereal-trace-1 packet trace to answer the
questions below:


1)
48 bit Ethernet Address: 00:d0:59:a9:3d:68

2)
48-bit destination address in the Ethernet frame: 00:06:25:da:af:73

3)
Type: IP 0x0800

4)
After 432 bits or 54 bytes, the G in getting appears.

5)
The Source address is 00:06:25:da:af:73. This address is the address of
my router/internet gateway address.

6)
The Destination address is 00:d0:59:a9:3d:68. This is the Ethernet
address of my computer.

7)
The two-byte frame type field is 0x0800. The bit that is valued to 1 says
to not fragment the set.


8)
The ASCII “O” appears 52 bytes from the start of the ethernet frame.
Again, there are 14 bytes of Ethernet frame, and then 20 bytes of IP
header followed by 20 bytes of TCP header before the HTTP data is
encountered.


II. The Address Resolution Protocol
------------------------------------

The Windows arp command with no arguments will display the contents of the ARP cache on your computer. Run
the arp command. 


9)
The Internet Address column contains the IP address, the Physical
Address column contains the MAC address, and the type indicates the
protocol type.

10)
The hex value for the source address is 00:d0:59:a9:3d:68. The hex
value for the destination address is ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, the broadcast address.

11)
The hex value for the Ethernet Fram type field is 0x0806, for ARP.

12)
a) The ARP opcode field begins 20 bytes from the very beginning of the
Ethernet frame.

b) The hex value for opcode field withing the ARP-payload of the request
is 0x0001, for the request.

c) Yes, the ARP message contains the IP address 192.168.1.105 for the
sender.

d) The field “Target MAC address” is set to 00:00:00:00:00:00 to
question the machine whose corresponding IP address (192.168.1.1) is
being queried.

13)
a) The ARP opcode field begins 20 bytes from the very beginning of the
Ethernet frame.

b)The hex value for opcode field withing the ARP-payload of the request
is 0x0002, for the reply.

c) The answer to the earlier ARP request appears in the”Sender MAC
address” field, which contains the Ethernet address 00:06:25:da:af:73 for
the sender with IP address 192.168.1.1.

Answer-14
The hex value for the source address is 00:06:25:da:af:73 and for the
destination is 00:d0:59:a9:3d:68.

15)
There is no reply in this trace because we are not at the machine that
sent the request. The ARP request is broadcast, but the ARP reply is sent
back directly to the sender’s Ethernet address.
